# Employee Tracker üë®‚Äçüíºüë©‚Äçüíº


## Description
This employee tracker is built using Javascript along with MySQL and Inquirer to be a simple CLI Employee Management System, capable of adding employees, altering roles, creating roles and departments and viewing all of this information. The backbone of this database is mysql which is queried using user input to produce the desired results. Challenges faced while making this were working with queries and mysql2 within the app. While building this I learned much about SQL queries and working with mysql within a node application.

Upon running ```npm start``` the client is presented with a welcome message and a list showing options. Pressing up and down on the arrow keys followed by Enter allow for client to select desired action and they will then be prompted with new questions to build out the content.
